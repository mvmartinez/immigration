    <h1>Additional Resources</h1>
    <article class="intro">
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to begin educating yourself on the issues surrounding immmigration in the United States. We want to make it clear that this is by no means meant to be a comprehensive resource. There are many more issues people face when it comes to immigration, and as active community members we all need to do our part to educate ourselves and help our neighbors when they need it. We also do not want to speak over immigrant voices, rather, we should all do our part to uplift and amplify them. </p>
      <p>Here are a couple resources to get you started with educating yourself and becoming an active member of our community, allyship does not end at educating yourself.</p>

      <h3>How to Support Undocumented Individuals</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">If you want to advocate for undocumented individuals, advocate for everyone! Not just those with DACA, not just those who can “contribute to the economy,” everyone is worthy and has a right to a life. A lot of undocumented people are in this country because it is difficult to make a living in their home country, no one is interested in stealing your job or resources.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Often times undocumented indivduals are exploited and paid under the table unlivable wages. Put pressure on officials to end unethical business practices. Under the current system, undocumented workers have very little rights, never ask someone about their status as that can put them in danger. If you know of or see any ICE raids, warn your neighbors, this can mean the difference between life and death. Remember, no one has to prove their worth to be treated as a human</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Never speak for anyone. Undocumented individuals are not “voiceless” you don’t need to be the “voice of the voiceless.” They’re real people, with real feelings, and their own voices. Instead, we should uplift them and not assume what their goals are.</p>

        <h4>DACA Update</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">As of <b>July 28th, 2020</b> DHS is:</p>
        <ul class="dhs-update">
          <li class="paragraph">Not accepting new DACA applications. Those who qualify but were too young to apply when the Trump Administration ended the program in 2016, are still not eligible to apply</li>
          <li class="paragraph">Shortening the deffered action period from two years to one year. This means, DACA recipients have to reapply and pay the <b>$495 fee every year</b>. </li>
          <li class="paragraph">Rejecting Advanced Parole applications, except in extenuating situations. DACA recipients can't leave the country for any reason, unless DHS deems their excuse as "extenuating" at their own discretion.</li>

      <h3>Asylees and Refugees</h3>
      <h4>Asylees</h4>
      <section class="asylees">
        <p class="paragraph">As of March 20, 2020 the United States is denying access to asylum seekers, and are returning them to their country of origin or the Mexican border, including unaccompanied children. If an unaccompanied child is suspected to be ill, be a victim of human trafficking or returning them is not feasible for some reason, then they undergo the standard processing procedure (immigration forum). </p>
        <p class="paragraph">An asylee is any person who meets the international criteria of a refugee. Anyone who has a “well-founded fear” of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership of a specific social group and is forced to flee their country (including instances of war and violence) is deemed an asylee. <b>>A refugee is different from an asylee as they apply for protection from outside the country.</b> There are two types of asylum processes:
        </p>
        <ul class="asylum-processes">
          <li class="paragraph">Affirmative asylum process - An asylum seeker has up to one year after arriving in the U.S to apply for asylum. They can also apply at ports of entry, where a USCIS officer decides to accept or deny them. If the individual is denied after their visa is expired or at a port of entry without a visa, they can go through the defensive asylum process.</li>
          <li>Defensive asylum process - Individuals have the option to take this process if they receive a removal order (deportation) or are denied at a port of entry. In this process, the individual goes to immigration court, where a judge decides to grant or deny them asylum.</li>
        </ul>

They may also qualify for assistance, including cash, medical, housing, educational, and vocational services, to facilitate their economic and social integration."

        <h4>Refugees</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">There is not much of a difference between a refugee and an asylee besides legal procedures. By definition, a refugee is someone who applies for legal protection from outside the United States instead of within.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In contrast to asylum seekers, which do not have a legal cap, the president sets the ceiling for the number of refugees admitted. In 2020 Trump lowered it to 18,000 refugees. The process can take on average from 18 to 24 months. </p>

      <h3>Immigrants and the Poverty Line</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">15% of immigrants in the United States fall below the poverty threshold, in comparison to 13%. Many immigrants who come to the United States open their own businesses. One of the easiest ways to support immigrants is by purchasing from their businesses. We’ve also seen a trend during the past couple of years, where street vendors are questioned about having vendor licenses, and are sometimes attacked. If you see a street vendor being harassed do what you can to help. Don’t attempt to haggle with any small business owners/businesses, their labor is worthy of paying the full price!
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Contact your local and state officials and put pressure on them to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Many immigrants are working for unlivable wages, put pressure on your officials to pass legislation to combat that.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">If you are able, help out with mutual aid. Giving money directly to individuals is often more helpful than donating through large organizations, since it’s not always guaranteed the individuals they claim to help will see that aid. </p>

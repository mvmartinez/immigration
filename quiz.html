<p>DACA does not provide a path to citizenship for recipients. Itâ€™s very difficult for DACA recipients to become citizens actually because most are not eligible for a green card and a in order to become a citizen, one must first have a green card for 5 years. The primary way to get a green card is by something called Family Reunification which means an immediate relative or spouse who is a citizen must sponsor you and most people with DACA do not have that. </p>

  <p>-Although the jury is still out for Trump, Obama deported somewhere around 2.8 &mdash; 3.4 million people during his presidency.

  <p>The Department of Homeland Security was signed into law by President George W. Bush on November 25, 2002.
    ICE was established in March of 2003.
    The first step towards helping immigrants is to recognize that not all the current institutions have been around for a long time. Although the United States has a history of xenophobia, we need to stop normalizing the establishment of these new institutions, along with the long-standing ones.

  <p>To become a citizen, immigrants must first become a permanent resident (AKA green card holder) which is already very hard to get and can take a lot of time. Only after living in the US for five consecutive years as a green card holder may they apply for naturalization, which is the process of becoming a citizen. They must be 18 or older, be able to read, write, and speak basic English, understand the US constitution, have knowledge of the US history and government, and take the oath of allegiance to the US. Also to apply for naturalization they must pay a free of $725. This process can last 6-14 months. They must then complete an interview and test. The overall process is very very long and costly.</p>
